Basic Plan:

~ build basic structure of files
    - npm init
    - npm install everything --save
    - reference express in index.js
    - touch index.handlebars/main.handlebars/views/layouts/new/edit/artists/etc

~ attach database, connect and test

- set main screen to do the thing (list "all" artists, which will be the DB eventually, but for now dummy data), and test

- page to add new artist, test


Basic Structure:

- main page
    - list artists
    - artist submission
    - user login?
    - (from Spotify app: browse, radio, recently played, songs, albums, artists, stations, local files, playlists)
    
    
- Footer (from Spotify webpage)
